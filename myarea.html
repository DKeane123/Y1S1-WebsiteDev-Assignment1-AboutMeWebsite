                <h2>A little about Stoneyford</h2>
                <p class="p1">I live in the countryside outside Stoneyford Co. Kilkenny. Stoneyford is a nice little village located 20 minutes from Kilkenny City that has a small tight knit community that are very welcoming. I personally live outside Stoneyford in the contryside which I enjoy as the freedom of being allowed to explore nature and enjoy my hobbies without being hindered by the restricting nature of the city. I also enjoy how free of of noise and air polution that the countryside gives me which really adds to the relaxing experience.</p>

                <h2>The Stoneyford Area</h2>
                <p class="p2">There is a suprising amount to do in Stoneyford itself from the community hall with its playground and pitch, the pubs and Knockdrinna Farm and Caf√©, and community events like 5 and 10 km races. Stoneyford is also in close proximity to Kells, Thomastown, Mount Juliet, Knocktopher and the motorway with Waterford being only a 30 minute drive away.</p>
