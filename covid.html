                <h2>Early Covid-19</h2>
                <p class="p1">At the beginning of Covid I like many others had the idea that it would not really affect me or my life in a significant way and would be treated like the common flu but I was also like many wrong. It was a big shift in my education to be told that I would be suddenly be online for my classes using Zoom which was a program I was unfarmiliar with.</p>

                <h2>Mid Covid-19</h2>
                <p class="p4">Being unable to go out to see my friends was difficult for me as I enjoy being able to go out and have fun with a few friends on the weekends since we all lived in different parts of Kilkenny making it difficult to meet up.</p>
                <p class="p4">So with the Covid restrictions prohibiting us from seeing each other in person was a hard thing to grow accustomed to. So playing videogames and chatting online was the only way we could keep in touch with each other.</p>

                <h2>Late Covid-19</h2>
                <p class="p5">Doing my Leaving Certificate during a global pandemic was honestly a lot scarier to me than the pandemic itself due to the amount of uncertainty I as a student was left with.</p>
                <p class="p5"> The fact that something like this had never happened before left me with a lot of questions that nobody could answer which was very stressful initially but the introduction of accredited grades was a big help and allowed me to get the college course I wanted.</p>

                <h2>Covid-19 Now</h2>
                <p class="p6">Even though most of the restrictions have been lifted and life is beginning to return to normal, Covid-19 still poses a big threat to us in the coming months.</p>
                <p class="p6"> The thought of a new variant of the virus causing another lockdown is something that is always in the back of my mind nowadays but I do have to be thankful that no one I know or I got sick with Covid during the pandemic so far.</p>
