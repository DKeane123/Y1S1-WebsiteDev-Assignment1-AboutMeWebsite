                <p class="p1">and I made this website for an assignment in my applied computing course in Waterford Institute of Technology.</p>
                <p class="p2">Now for starters I just want to say the main purpose of this website is to test my abilities and show what I have learned so far in my Website Development classes so obviously you shouldnt expect this to be a well thought out project as most of the design decisions will seem</p>
